DESCRIPTION : This script is an advanced encryption tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for performing encryption and decryption operations.

The tool supports the following features:

*   Encryption: Encrypts a file using a password-based key derivation function (PBKDF2) and the AES-256 encryption algorithm.
*   Decryption: Decrypts a file using the same password-based key derivation function and the AES-256 encryption algorithm.
*   User-friendly interface: Provides a simple text-based interface for entering the password and selecting the operation to perform.
*   Error handling: Handles common errors such as permission errors and file not found errors.

The script is designed to be secure and efficient, using best practices for encryption and key management. It is suitable for use in a variety of applications, including data storage, file transfer, and secure communication.

To use the script, simply run it from the command line and follow the prompts to enter the password and select the operation to perform. The script will then perform the selected operation and display the results.
